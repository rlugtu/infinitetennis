In the group sessions he created such a positive environment to work hard and we all pushed each other every time to get better. I’ll never forget how competitive our “ringring” games got  Tatsumi put his whole heart and soul into helping every player. I’m very thankful for the time I spent working with him!",

Tatsumi was extremely disciplined and had a program sheet that was followed for everyday planning what drills we would do and who would play points together. The group also allowed me to make lifelong friends. I learned a lot from him about my technique, footwork, and the importance of taking care of your body!!",

In doing so, he taught me to set high goals, to hold myself accountable for attaining them, and to never give up. This attitude has helped me to realize my fullest potential - not only in tennis, but also in my studies and career. Ten years later, I still hold Tatsumi's teachings dear to my heart, and I believe that my days training under him have shaped me into the person who I am today."
