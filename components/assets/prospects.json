In the group sessions he created such a positive environment to work hard and we all pushed each other every time to get better. I’ll never forget how competitive our “ringring” games got  Tatsumi put his whole heart and soul into helping every player. I’m very thankful for the time I spent working with him!",

Tatsumi was extremely disciplined and had a program sheet that was followed for everyday planning what drills we would do and who would play points together. The group also allowed me to make lifelong friends. I learned a lot from him about my technique, footwork, and the importance of taking care of your body!!",

He will always find the time to coach all of his students and give them the attention/advice that they need to succeed. I enjoyed my time with him and the other coaches so much and formed relationships with them that will last a lifetime. I couldn’t be more grateful for what he had done for me, I wouldn’t be the player or person I am today without him.",
